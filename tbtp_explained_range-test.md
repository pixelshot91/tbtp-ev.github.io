## Test Summary
Similar to the [battery capacity test](tbtp_explained_battery-test.html), which is often done at the same time, the car under test is being fully charged and then driven to below 5% state of charge at 90 km/h or 120 km/h speed. The slower speed is meant to simulate a mix of highway and city driving while the 120 km/h speed test simulates typical mean highway speed. If the car for some reason can not be charged to 100% state of charge or not driven to below 5% state of charge the missing typical range is being calculated from measured battery size, available state of charge and consumption at certain speeds.
