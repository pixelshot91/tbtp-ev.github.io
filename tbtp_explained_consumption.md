## Test Summary
Consumption tests are most of the time being done at 90 km/h and 120 km/h. For the most accurate test results the car under test is being fully charged and then driven at fixed speed until below 5% state of charge. This also measures the car's range at the same time. It is important that the start and end location is the same to account for head / tail wind and height differences. Knowing the consumption of the car at certain speeds allows for accurate range calculation with known available battery size and optimizing charging strategy.
