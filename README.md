# Tesla Bjørn Test Procedure (TBTP)
This repository contains the website for Tesla Bjørn Test Procedure. TBTP is a set of tests and measurements for EVs developed by YouTuber [Bjørn Nyland](https://www.youtube.com/user/bjornnyland). It was developed to cover use cases and usage scenarios not tested by other test procedures. This site is powered by Jekyll and live on Github pages: [tbtp-ev.github.io](https://tbtp-ev.github.io)

# Information about test results
This repository is intended to gather all test results of TBTP in one place so they can easily be compared and all related videos are easily accessible. This would not have been possible without tesla Björn / [Bjørn Nyland](https://www.youtube.com/user/bjornnyland) who invests time and money to test as many cars as possible. Please support whenever and whereever you can:

# Adding test results
If you want to add new cars or test results feel free to do so. All data is saved inside this repositories [tested_cars data folder](https://github.com/tbtp-ev/tbtp-ev.github.io/tree/master/_tested_cars). You can fork the repository, update or add files and issue a pull request. Each car has it's own ".md" file in which certain variables are defined which contain the cars test results. Once a new file has been added or updated the site will automatically generate a new page and add teh test results to all overviews. Make sure you use the "__template.md" file if you want to add a new car and / or use the same data structure as on existing test results or generating the website will fail.

Please note that only this site is specifically targeting TBTP and thus only videos and tests by [Bjørn Nyland](https://www.youtube.com/user/bjornnyland) are accepted for now.
