## Test Summary
The banana box test is divided into two parts: First as many banana boxes as possible will be placed into the trunk of the car under test. If the car has a frunk with enough space to fit an additional box, then that one is added to the result. After that the car seats get folded down and once again as many boxes as possible are placed in the car. Each banana box is of a fixed size of 16 inches (~40 cm) by 20 inches (~50 cm) by 10 inches (25 cm). As it is not allowed to damage any box during this test it simulates cargo e.g. luggage which is of a fixed size and can't be bend to fit the theoretical volume in liters of a trunk / frunk.
